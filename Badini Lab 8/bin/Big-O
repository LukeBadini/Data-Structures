  Random: Based on the data, the equation for the trendline
          for array accesses vs array length suggests that
          for a random array, the Big-O runtime is
          O(n^2).
  
  Identical: Since the number of array accesses is the same no matter
             what the length of the array is, the worst-case runtime
             for an array of identical numbers is O(1).
  
  Sorted: Since the number of array accesses is the same no matter
          what the length of the array is, the worst-case runtime
          for a sorted array is O(1).
          
  Reverse Sorted: Based on the data, the equation for the trendline
                  for array accesses vs array length suggests that
                  for a reverse-sorted array, the Big-O runtime is
                  O(n^2).
