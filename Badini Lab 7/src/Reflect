 1. setStart and setEnd are specific to Events since Reminders
    don't have a start time and an end time. As such, if we tried to
    call setStart and setEnd on a Reminder LogEntry, we would run 
    into an error. On the other hand, both Reminders and Events have
    years, months, days, and we can represent them both as strings.
    We can put these methods into the interface because all of these
    methods work on both types of objects.
 
 2. It would not be a good design decision to put setStart and setEnd
    inside the interface because it requires the user to keep track
    of what is an Event and what is a Reminder. In order to fix this,
    Reminders would need to be given a start time and an end time if
    setStart and setEnd were inside the interface.
    
 3. I had to object cast in my alteringEvents method because the
    compiler thinks things inside the LogBook are of type LogEntry.
    Since I know what I'm looking for is an Event, I needed to cast
    the LogEntry object as an Event object to get the code to
    compile.
