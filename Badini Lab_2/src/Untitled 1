1.
The first line in the code creates a spot in memory for a DrawingBoard 
object called myBoard. As of the first line, the value that this spot
in memory points to is null. The second line of the code creates a new
DrawingBox object in memory and points the myBoard spot in memory
to that object. The third line calls the setVisible DrawingBox
method on myBoard and passes the boolean true into it which makes
myBoard visible. The final line calls the drawRect DrawingBox method
on myBoard and passes 4 numbers into it. These represent the x value,
y value, width, and height of the rectangle. These two methods are not
being performed on the myBoard object itself, but the space in memory
myBoard points to, which is a DrawingBoard object.

2.
The DrawingBox constructor is called in the second line. We knew it
was legal to use the constructor method with no arguments because in
the JavaDocs is says that it can take no arguments and returns a
DrawingBox with the default title. DrawingBox can also accept 
String arguments in which case it assigns the argument as the title
of the DrawingBox.

3.
drawRect represents a method that can be called on DrawingBox objects.
The first version of drawRect is being used because it takes 4 arguments
while the second version takes 1 argument. The second version also takes
Rectangle arguments while the first version takes integer arguments.
In the first version, the arguments represent the x value, y value, 
width, and height of the rectangle. In the second version, the argument
represents a Rectangle object.
