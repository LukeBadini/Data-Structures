 1. removeHead: O(1)
    insertAtTail: O(n)
    search: O(n)

 2. a. Instead of being O(1) time, removeHead would be O(n) time
       because you would need to use a for loop to move everything
       in the list 1 slot to the left.
    b. The runtime would be the same because both cases still need
       to iterate through the list in order to find the correct event.
