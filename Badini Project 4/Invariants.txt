Sequence Invariant:

1. The number of elements in the
   sequence is stored in the instance
   variable manyItems

2. For an empty sequence, we do not care
   what is stored in any of data; for a
   non-empty sequence, the elements of 
   the sequence are stored from the front
   to the end in data[0] to data[manyItems-1]
   and we don't care what is stored in the
   rest of data

3. If there is a current element, then it
   lies in data[currentIndex]; if there is
   no current element, then currentIndex
   equals -1
