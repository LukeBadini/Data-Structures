   
   size: The runtime for the size method is constant because when I
         make a call to the LinkedList size method, no matter what
         the size of the Stack is, there is only 1 line of code
         being executed.
   
   isEmpty: The runtime for the isEmpty method is constant because
            when I make a call to the LinkedList isEmpty method, no
            matter what the size of the Stack is, there is only 1
            line of code being executed.
   
   push: The runtime for the push method is constant because when I
         make a call to the LinkedList insertAtHead method, no matter
         what size the Stack is, there are only 4 line of code being
         executed.
   
   pop: The runtime of the pop method is constant because when I
        make a call to the LinkedList removeHead method, no matter
        what size the Stack is, there are at most 4 lines of code
        being executed.
   
   top: The runtime of the top method is constant because when I
        make a call to the LinkedList elementAtHead method, no matter
        what size the Stack is, there is only 1 line of code being
        executed.
